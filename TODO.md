Priority:
- particles and punctuation -> add more sentences and tests to check if it works
- multi kanji sequences -> need dictionary + mock for the tests?

Average:
- suru irregular
- kuru irregular
- adjectives conjugation? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_verb_conjugation

Later:
- half width characters? full-width roman chars?
- implement down migrations
