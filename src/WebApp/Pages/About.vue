		<h1>History</h1>

		<p>Hello, I am SÃ©bastien, a French guy living in Tokyo.</p>

		<p>
			I spent many years studying Japanese, and one of the biggest frustrations
			I had was the impossibility to progress by reading.
		</p>
		<p>
			I love reading, and reading in a foreign language is an amazing experience and made me progress really fast when I studied English.
			I wanted to do the same in Japanese, but I found that the Kanjis makes this process very difficult.
		</p>
		<p>
			There was already a ton of applications to study vocabulary, but nothing that could really help me to understand rich and native content.
		</p>
		<p>
			Kanjimi was born during the Coronavirus-pandemic of 2020.
		</p>
